Currently recreating the game BattleCON Online (https://store.steampowered.com/app/792570/BattleCON_Online/).
Afterwards, we can start running simulations and possibly training an AI with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
  A DQN (https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning) seems appropriate, but I am no expert yet.
Simulation code is in Game.py
